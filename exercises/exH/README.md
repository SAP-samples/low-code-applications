# Exercise H â€” Test the app and the scenario

We can now test the new app and the whole scenario.

To test have your mobile phone ready and make sure you have the **AppGyver Preview** app installed as indicated in [Exercise 0](../ex0/README.md).

In the AppGyver Composer on your desktop, invoke the **Launch** tab in the toolbar at the top of the screen.

Here under **Mobile App** press on the square that says **Reveal QR Code**. The result should look like this:

Now open the AppGyver Preview App on your phone. You should see this (If you don't press on your name one the top of your screen and in the account page, press **Log out**)

Press the the **Scan QR Code** button. After some seconds you should see your app popping up like this:

Press on the **Open** button of your application.

Now fill in some data. For the **Cost center** you can either type a number in or try a QR code for example this one:

Cost center: 948590438590489043890548 

If you press the **Scan QR** button in your AppGyver app you can scan it.

When finished with your input, press the **Submit Request** Button

Now let's check if the new registration is showing up in the list report app from the earlier exercise. For this, if not still open, bring up the application overview page (where again XXX is your user number)

```

```

Open the list report and press **Go** to get the list. This should now include the new record:
