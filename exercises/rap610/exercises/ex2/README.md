# Exercise 2: Create the OnlineShop Application

## Introduction

In this exercise, you will use the package `Z_ONLINESHOP_###`that you have created earlier. 
Here you will create a database table where you will define all important fields for the OnlineShop application.  

This RAP BO represents an online shop, where you can order laptops or other articles you need as an employee. After an article such as a laptop is ordered, a purchase requisition can be created by pressing a button in your application which will trigger an action in your RAP BO.  

This could also simulate an additional approval step that can only be performed if the application is used by a manager.

We will start our implementation by building a simple managed RAP business object and we will add the business logic to call the released RAP API in SAP S/4HANA in the second exercise of this workshop.

You will use an ADT wizard to generate all the needed development RAP artefacts of your UI service. This includes the data model, projection view, service definition and service binding. Afterwards you will check your _OnlineShop_ application with the SAP Fiori elements preview.

> **Reminder:**   
> Don't forget to replace all occurences of the placeholder **`###`** with your group ID in the exercise steps below.  
> You can use the ADT function **Replace All** (**Ctrl+F**) for the purpose.

## Exercise 1.1: Create database table
[^Top of page](#)


Create a database table![table](../../images/adt_tabl.png) to store the _OnlineShop_ data.   
A OnlineShop entity defines general data, such as the item name or or the number of items, overall status of the order, and the total price of the order. Once the order is checked out the number of the purchase requisition that will be created by using our released API will be stored as well.

## Exercise 1.2: Generate the transactional UI services
[^Top of page](#)



Create your OData v4 based UI services with the built-in ADT generator.   
The generated business service will be transactional, draft-enabled, and enriched with UI semantics for the generation of the Fiori elements app.

   1. Right-click your database table ![table](../../images/adt_tabl.png)**`zaonlineshop_###`**  and select **Generate ABAP Repository Objects** from the context menu.        
   
   2. Maintain the required information  (`###` is your group ID) and click **Next >**:
        - Description: **`Onlineshop App ###`**
        - Generator: **`ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model: UI Service`**
        
   3. Maintain the required information on the **Configure Generator** dialog to provide the name of your data model and generate them.

## Exercise 1.3: Preview the OnlineShop App in in SAP S/4HANA Cloud
[^Top of page](#)

In this exercise you will publish the local service endpoint of your service binding ![service binding](../../images/adt_srvb.png) and start the _Fiori elements App Preview_.

> **Note:**
> If you are using an on premise system please continue with the next exercise.

 <details>

> **On premise issue**   
> If you are working on an on premise system and try to use the **Publish** or **Publish Locally** button you will see the following error message
> ![on prem error](images/100_error_publish_service_binding.png)



   1. Open your service binding ![service binding](../../images/adt_srvb.png)**`ZUI_ONLINESHOP_O4_###`** and click **Publish**.
   
   2. Double-click on the entity **`OnlineShop`** in the **Entity Set and Association** section to open the _Fiori elements App Preview_.   
   
   3. Click the button on the _OnlineShop_ app **Go** to load the data.
       
   4. Check your result.

## Exercise 1.4: Preview the Online Shop App in SAP S/4HANA on premise
[^Top of page](#)

> Publishing the local service endpoint of your service binding **in on premise systems** does not work from within ADT. 
> Therefore you have to publish the Service Binding locally using transaction **/IWFND/V4_ADMIN**.

> Hint:
> The screen shots show the steps for the *Travel* app. Please use the names and strings provided in this script in **step 4 & 5** and do NOT enter the names you see on the screen shots.

## Summary 
[^Top of page](#)

Now that you've... 
- created an ABAP package,
- created a database table and fill it with demo data,
- created a transactional UI service,
- published a local service point, and started the _Fiori elements App Preview_ in ADT,

you can continue with the next exercise - **[Exercise 3: Adapt the data model](../ex3/README.md)**.
